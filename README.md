#  Aerosight – Airline Market Demand Insights

Aerosight is a lightweight Python web application built with Flask that visualizes live airline flight data using the OpenSky Network API. The dashboard provides real-time insights into flight demand, popular origin countries, and simulated price trends based on selected country filters.

---

##  Features

-  Real-time flight data fetched from [OpenSky Network API](https://opensky-network.org/)
-  Interactive bar chart for Top 5 Origin Countries
-  Simulated pricing trends by country (randomized)
-  Country-based filtering with dropdown
-  Last updated timestamp for data freshness
-  Clean and responsive UI using Bootstrap 5
-  Optimized with caching to reduce API calls

## Simulated Price Trends

The app generates random price values (₹200 – ₹800) for each top country on every refresh. This demonstrates pricing trend simulation, useful when real pricing APIs are not available for free.

>  Each country could be further improved by mapping with real currency codes and exchange rates.

---

##  Improvements & Suggestions

- Replace simulated price data with real APIs (Skyscanner, Amadeus, FlightAware)
- Add login/authentication for users
- Include departure/destination filtering
- Add multi-day trends and time-series analysis
